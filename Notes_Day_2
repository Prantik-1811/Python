 Strings

 A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered 
a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your 
strings like this: 
"This is a string."
 'This is also a string.'

This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your 
strings

'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
 "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
 "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."

Changing Case in a String with Method

name = "ada lovelace"
 print(name.title())
 Save this file as name.py, and then run it. You should see this output:
 Ada Lovelace

A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot 
(.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on 
the variable name

That informa
tion is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need 
any additional information, so its parentheses are empty. 
The title() method changes each word to title case, where each word 
begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think 
of a name as a piece of information.
