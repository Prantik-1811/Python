Python Notes (Beginner and Basic Stuff)

You can run Python’s interpreter in a terminal window, allowing you to try 
bits of Python code without having to save and run an entire program

Example:   >>> print("Hello Python interpreter!") 
Hello Python interpreter!

>>> prompt indicates that you should be using the terminal (Powershell also works if u have an added path during installation of Python)
window, and the bold text is the code you should type in and then execute by 
pressing enter

Extra:  About the Sublime Text Editor
Sublime Text is a simple text editor that can be installed on all modern 
operating systems. Sublime Text lets you run almost all of your programs 
directly from the editor instead of through a terminal. Your code runs in 
a terminal session embedded in the Sublime Text window, which makes it 
easy to see the output


**WHILE INSTALLATION CLICKING ADD TO PATH IS NECESSARY**
